## What is Steganography? 🌐

Steganography is the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret data.
It allows you to hide the existence of a message by embedding it within another medium, such as images, audio files, video files, or even text. 
Steganography helps ensure the privacy and confidentiality of information by making the hidden message blend seamlessly with its carrier medium.
